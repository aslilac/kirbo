# kirbo_firewall

This package exists purely out of spite, with a massive performance improvement being a secondary benefit.

It contains many popular npm packages that aren't worth even downloading from the registry. Their functionality has been reimplemented from scratch, and stripped down to the absolute bare minimum, saving us from needing to flood your node_modules/ folder with README.md files and Github actions configurations. Each package is implemented as a single JavaScript file.
